/*Optimization: 
 * Since we are using Recurrsion there is a chnace of calculating the already known value
 * that's the reason why the idea of memoization came into the picture
 * Let's think of a situation first we have called this function to know the final value after 7 years so it calculates 
 * as expected using normal recurrsion but the next time onwards when we call with years = 15 it goes deeper and deeper
 * at a certain point it need to calculate at no.of years = 7 but we have already done with that so no need of 
 * calculating it again. 
 * This shows the usefulness of memoization â€” by avoiding redundant calculations (e.g., saving 8 repeated calls), 
 * it significantly reduces computation, especially for large inputs.

 * therefore, currValue = prevValue + prevValue*(growth/100)
