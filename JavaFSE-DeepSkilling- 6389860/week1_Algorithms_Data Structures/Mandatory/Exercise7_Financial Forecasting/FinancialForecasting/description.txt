Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting

Understand Recursive Algorithms:
Q) Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Recursion is a widely used concept in DSA to solve the problems where we need to find all the possibilities to come to a conclusion for a certain problem.
Recursion means solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving each recursively. In many cases, it helps explore all possibilities or build on previous results.

for this particular question we can apply recursion since to calculate the final value after N years first we need know/have the value of N-1 th year then we calculate as follows:

value after Nth year = (value after N-1 years) + (value after N-1 years * (growth/100))

But For the N-1th year, we don’t know the value yet.

therefore, value after N-1 years =  (value after N-2 years) + (value after N-2 years*(growth/100))
.
.
.
this will go on
at a certain point we get 0 years means the principle value/ initial amount is itself the final value

Recursion tree:
value(N)
   |
   V
value(N-1)
   |
   V
value(N-2)
   |
   V
   .
   .
   . 
   |
   V
value(0) = inital value

In this problem, even though there’s only one path of execution (no branching), the Nth year depends on the (N-1)th year, which makes it a perfect fit for recursion, also we can go with iterative approach.
