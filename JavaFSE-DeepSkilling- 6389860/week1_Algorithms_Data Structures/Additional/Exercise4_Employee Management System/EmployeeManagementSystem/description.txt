Exercise 4: Employee Management System

Understand Array Representation:

Q) Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements (usually of the same data type) in contiguous memory locations. Each element is accessed using an index, typically starting from 0.


if take an array of integers, since integer size is 4 bytes the representation is as follows:

arr	4bytes	4bytes	4bytes	4bytes	4bytes	4bytes
	1000	1004	1008	1012	1016	1020


The first element of the array is placed at a base address.

Elements are accessed using an index, which is calculated as:

address = base address + (index * size of each element)


Advantages of Arrays:

Fast Access - O(1)
Efficient for Iteration


Q) Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).

Add - O(1) - go the available index adds the element constant time operation 

Search - O(n) - Search by employeeId or name etc.	

Traverse - O(n) - Visit every element	

Delete - O(n) =	first we need to find the element and shift elements after deletion


Q) Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.

Fixed Size
Inefficient Deletion/Insertion
No Dynamic Resizing
