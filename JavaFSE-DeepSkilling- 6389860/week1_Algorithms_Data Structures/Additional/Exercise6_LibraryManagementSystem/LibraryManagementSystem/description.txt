Exercise 6: Library Management System

Understand Search Algorithms:

Q) Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.

Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that checks each element one by one from the beginning until the target element is found or the end is reached.

steps:

Start from index 0.

Compare each element with the target.

Return index if found, else return -1.



Binary Search: An efficient search algorithm that repeatedly divides the sorted list of elements in half to find the target.

steps:

Sort the list first (it is the first and most imp step in binary search if the array is not sorted then we get undesired behaviour when we run the code)

Compare the target with the middle element. (mid = (low + high)/2)

if equal, return index.

if target < middle -> search left half.

if target > middle -> search right half.


Q) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.

Operation	Linear Search		Binary Search

Best Case	    O(1)		    O(1)
Average Case	    O(n)		  O(log n)
Worst Case	    O(n)		  O(log n)



Q) Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

when the data set size is small / unsorted then it is better use Linear Search.

when the data set size is large / sorted then it is better to use Binary search.

if we need faster look ups in the list of elements it is better to go with binary Search.
