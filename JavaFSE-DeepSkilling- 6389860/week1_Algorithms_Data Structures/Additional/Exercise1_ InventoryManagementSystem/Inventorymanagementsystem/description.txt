Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

Understand the Problem:

Q)Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

In a warehouse, there may be hundreds or thousands of products. Managing this inventory efficiently requires:
Fast lookups to find a product by its ID.
Quick updates when stock changes.
Accurate deletions of removed products.
Minimal memory usage and low processing time.
Without efficient data structures and algorithms, these operations become slow, inefficient, and can resulted in errors as the dataset grows.


Q) Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

HashMap (Map<Integer, Product>)    -Allows O(1) time for add, update, delete, and search using productId as key.
ArrayList (List<Product>)	   -Easy to traverse and display all products, but slower (O(n)) for searching/updating by productId.


Analysis:
Q) Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Using HashMap is Best Suits the Inventory management System as it's time complexity is O(1) for all search, delete, add, update.

Q) Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Using HashMap instead of ArrayList to avoid linear searches.
For ordered display, using LinkedHashMap (preserves insertion order).
